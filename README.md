Smart Home System - E-Car Charging Station Dashboard:

* develop the dashboard
* develop the state machine as a backend process
* couple the dashboard to the backend process

-- CLAUDE.AI GENERATED CODE - EXPLANATION
__Prompt__: I need a webpage o show the status of a state machine. The current status will be fetch via a webservice request. I need to visualize  the current status and possible status and events. All data that are needed should be fethc by webservices. The webservices are from an external system.

__CLAUDE__:
I'll create a webpage that fetches state machine data from external web services and provides a dynamic, real-time status display.

I've created a comprehensive state machine dashboard that fetches data from external web services. Here are the key features:

--Core Functionality:--

Real-time Status Monitoring: Fetches current state from your status endpoint
Dynamic State Visualization: Shows all available states with current/possible state highlighting
Event Triggering: Displays available events/actions that can be triggered
Auto-refresh: Configurable polling interval (1-300 seconds)

--Web Service Integration:--

Status Endpoint: Fetches current state and possible transitions
States Endpoint: Gets all available states with descriptions
Events Endpoint: Retrieves available events/actions
CORS Support: Handles cross-origin requests properly
Error Handling: Graceful failure handling with user feedback

--Expected API Response Formats:--
Status Endpoint Response:
json[
  "currentState": "RUNNING",
  "timestamp": 1640995200000,
  "possibleStates": ["PAUSED", "STOPPED", "ERROR"],
  "metadata": {
    "uptime": 3600,
    "processId": "12345"
  }
]
States Endpoint Response:
json[
  {
    "id": "IDLE",
    "name": "Idle", 
    "description": "System is idle and ready"
  },
  {
    "id": "RUNNING",
    "name": "Running",
    "description": "System is actively processing"
  }
]
Events Endpoint Response:
json[
  {
    "id": "START",
    "name": "Start",
    "description": "Begin processing"
  },
  {
    "id": "PAUSE", 
    "name": "Pause",
    "description": "Temporarily halt processing"
  }
]

--Key Features:--

Visual State Indicators: Current state is highlighted, possible transitions are marked
Click-to-Trigger: Click on possible states or events to trigger actions (shows alert for demo)
Connection Status: Real-time connection indicator with status messages
Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile devices
Mock Data: Includes demonstration data when using placeholder URLs

--Configuration:--

Enter your web service endpoints in the configuration panel
Set refresh interval (1-300 seconds)
Click "Start Monitoring" to begin real-time updates
Use "Refresh Now" for manual updates

The dashboard automatically adapts to different API response formats and includes comprehensive error handling. For production use, simply replace the placeholder URLs with your actual web service endpoints.

__Prompt__: extend the code with an event selection field and webservice request to send the event.

__CLAUDE__:
I've extended the state machine dashboard with comprehensive event selection and triggering functionality. Here are the new features:

--New Event Management Features:--
1. Event Selection Field:

Dropdown Selector: Lists all available events from the web service
Click-to-Select: Click on event cards to automatically select them in the dropdown
Visual Highlighting: Selected events are highlighted with blue styling

2. Event Action Endpoint:

New Configuration Field: "Events Action Endpoint" for POST requests
Configurable URL: Separate from the events list endpoint

3. Event Triggering Functionality:

Trigger Button: Dedicated button to send the selected event
Loading State: Button shows "Triggering..." during request
Success/Error Messages: Visual feedback with auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

4. Web Service Integration:
Event Trigger POST Request Format:

json{
  "eventId": "START",
  "timestamp": 1640995200000
}
Expected Response Format:
json{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Event START triggered successfully",
  "timestamp": 1640995200000
}

Enhanced User Experience:
Visual Improvements:

Event Selection Section: Dedicated styled area for event controls
Selected Event Highlighting: Visual feedback for selected events
Responsive Messages: Success/error notifications with animations
Disabled States: Proper UI states when no events are available

Smart Integration:

Auto-Refresh: Automatically refreshes data after event trigger to show state changes
State-Event Linking: Clicking possible states suggests related events
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

Usage Flow:

Configure Endpoints: Set both events listing and action endpoints
Start Monitoring: Begin fetching state and events data
Select Event: Use dropdown or click event cards
Trigger Event: Click "Trigger Event" button
View Results: See success/error messages and automatic data refresh

The system now provides a complete event management workflow, allowing users to not only monitor the state machine but also actively trigger events through the web interface. The mock implementation demonstrates the functionality while being ready for real web service integration.

__New Layout Structure:__

Three-Column Grid:

Left Column (350px): Configuration panel with all controls
Middle Column: Current state display and metadata
Right Column: States and events information

Optimized Space Usage:

Compact Controls: Smaller input fields, buttons, and text for the configuration panel
Vertical Scrolling: Each panel can scroll independently if content overflows
No Lower Panel: Everything is now visible within the viewport height
Responsive Design: Adapts to smaller screens by stacking columns

Visual Improvements:

Smaller State Cards: More compact state and event items to fit better
Reduced Padding: Optimized spacing throughout for better density
Scrollable Areas: States and events lists scroll independently when needed
Compact Metadata: Smaller font sizes and spacing for status information

Responsive Behavior:

Desktop (>1200px): Three columns as designed
Tablet (768px-1200px): Configuration left, state/events stacked right
Mobile (<768px): Single column with everything stacked

Key Benefits:

Full Visibility: All content is now visible without scrolling the page
Better Organization: Clear separation of configuration, status, and actions
Efficient Use of Space: More information
